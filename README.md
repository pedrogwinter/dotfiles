My personal backup dotfiles.

fell free to use it as you like.

It works on my machine, I can't guarantee that it will work on yours.

I use fedora, so, the package names can (and probably will) be different on another distro.

It's not ready yet, but a work in progress...

I accept suggestions and any help that you may wanna give.
